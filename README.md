# DH110_Assign6

<h2>Description of project: </h2>
<p>While low-fidelity prototyping allows us to study the general idea of the screens/steps we hope to create for our designs, high fidelity prototyping (but this assignment in particular) allows us to highlight a single component of our app and gather feedback of items that are directly related to the constitution of the app (i.e.font, color scheme, text size, image size, etc.) Basically high fidelity testing gets us as close as we can get to the actual application/website UI without actually constructing the entire application/website. Another interesting outcome of high-fidelity  testing is that we are also able to more accurately time how long a user takes to do a task.</p>
  
 So for my screen designs, the user will be joining a book group by searching for them in the search bar. The basic system steps are:
 <ol>
  <li> home page shows the most popular books right now. taskbar is at the bottom and there is a search icon at the top of the screen as well as within taskbar </li>
  <li> clicking on either search icon, opens up a list of choices to narrow search for user </li>
  <li> user clicks on options to narrow down search </li>
  <li> user clicks on search icon again to initiate the search process </li>
  <li> results are separated by books, lists, and book groups</li>
   <li> user can click from the results page to open up the "profile/information page" or can click on the arrows to open more results related to book groups</li>
   <li> an informational profile page of the book group opens and at the bottom is a join option</li>
   <li> user clicks JOIN button to join group</li>
 <li> a pop up confirming the user joined the group appears </li>
   <li> user clicks on "X" button located on the upper right part of the screen to go back to the previous page </li>
  </ol>


<h2>Design System:</h2>

<h3>Font: Libre Baskerville</h3>
<p>The font I chose for my screen designs is Libre Baskerville. Since it is taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast”  it is suitable for reading on the screen. It is primarily used for body text and since my current and future screen designs will be using a lot of text, I think using Libre Baskerville as the principal font is a good choice. Once again, this is the only font I am using to make sure the overall design of the prototype is cohesive but I am considering adding another font to differentiate between the “bookish” details and app features (for example book titles vs search results). Also, the font reminds me of a more modern version of the actual fonts used in physical books. I also added a period after most of the titles in the app to maintain a "bookish" mode. But after I add in the logo, I think I may remove the periods since hopefully, the logo will be enough to maintain the mood I want. </p>

<h3>Color scheme: background, primary (default text), focus (ex. button)</h3>
<p>Figuring out the color palette was difficult. I did try to make the process of choosing one easier by relying on color psychology but even researching the colors and the associated meanings made it a bit harder. Since this is a social and an archive app, it has to highlight the books themselves as well as the sense of the community users will experience when they use the app. So I wanted the color palette to be warm and inviting… a bit like actual books. Below I included the color palettes passing the contrast test: the top one is the one I am using for the light mode and beige variations of the app while the second one is for the dark mode variation.

**Layout grid + spacing:**
<p>I am still researching the best way to go about the layout of the app. As I was studying different apps, I see that the biggest issue many have is following the Gestalt Principle of Proximity. Poor formatting can lead to different sections being too close to one another (like the in class assignment I did on Suzanne Collins website) and cause readability to be difficult. I also remembered that for many years, GoodReads (a social and archive app about books) had a poor layout grid since text and hyperlinks seemed to be in random places on their website. So that is also another aspect, having a layout grid that does not make sense, I am trying to avoid it. Right now, I am currently using lines to separate different sectioned text. For example, the search results have very faint lines separating each search result. And on book groups’ discussion pages, the different section titles are underlined to differentiate between one another. For the spacing between components I did it manually but I will try to update the design so that I am using the "Stack" feature of Framer. </p>

**Impression Test Recording:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kbLD0B-DiDlFMAzJaKJaApqfqmYTgkJn/view?usp=sharing

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p> Honestly, as I was creating the screens, I already changed my mind on how the results will be shown. The ideas I have seem to involve coding so hopefully for the next assignment it will be ready. For the Impression Test, I saw that there are two variations: 1.) a 15 second glance then discussion 2.) a minute long test where the user goes through the steps/screens. I decided to do both! 

**First Impression Test:** for the 15 second glance I showed the screenshots I took for the light mode and dark mode variations. For the light mode, the user commented "That it looks real." "simple." "very simple." "bookie!". Simplicity was what I was going for so I am happy they commented that. 
For the dark mode, "it looks real." "smart." like I get it." I think for their last comment, they mean the color scheme for dark mode since the quote before (seemed to be) pertained to the color scheme as well.

**Second Impression Test**
a minute long test: asked them to search for a book group to join by searching for one using the sear bar. They completed the task very quickly so I told them to take their time until the minute is up. 

Some thoughts they had: "it was difficult to start." since they did not know how to begin the task. I did try to prompt them but they would just say by asking "How was your experience" and "Any thoughts you have?" The latter question I hoped would lead to more opinions being shared since I learned in one of my linguistics class, that "any" while used in negative sentences, can elicit responses since it causes people to think to see if they actually have **just any** thoughts/opinions/questions. The user simply said "it was nice." And honestly, I do consider this a bit of a victory since for my last prototype, my drawings were comical to the other user. So not having a definite opinion of the app is fine for me right now since it shows my prototype is "mundane" enough to pass off as an actual interference. 

**Final Thoughts:** As mentioned before, I already know what I want to change: the search function and the layout of the results page. For my initial search option, I was inspired by Discord's search function since it makes it so easy to find messages so while I think a similar one may work for my app, I think for the intended users, it will be better if I change it. I did not go through many difficulties, I just struggled a bit understanding how Framer components work but I plan on studying them more to use them later. But I also just felt limited by my own knowledge. I am a Linguistics major; however, I have not yet formally studied topics related to "Localization" (a field I am interested in). I felt applying some here would be suitable for my app since I plan on adding multi-language support.


<h2> PART 2 </h2>
**Interactive Prototype:** https://framer.com/projects/Assignment6-copy--yxiyYMQgpb9gkssbnTZC-3dFlU
I included a new task and also revamped the previous one I created interactions for.

**The old, revamped task:** Users are looking for book groups to join using the search icon or search bar. There is now a discover page.

**The new task:** users are going through the settings to change the language

**General updates to the interface I made:** increased font size, more buttons are being used. Added the star rating

**Font**
- on the results page --> book and group titeles used 
- 

**Future Plans and Thoughts:** As of right now, before the cognitive walkthrough, I do plan on changing the home screen to show updates from friends/authors/groups/etc. I plan on adding in text onto the taskbar. From research, older aged users prefer texts over icons so I plan on incorporating both. The text will at minimum be 12 pt and bolded. I was considering changing the color scheme since “blue” tends to help users relax and for the elderly, new technology can be daunting; however, it seems that colors within the blue-green spectrum are harder for them to distinguish so I am keeping the color scheme.


<h3>Task One: Updated Wireflow on Joining a Book Group </h3>

**Basic Steps**
 <ol>
  <li> wherever you are on the app, you click the farthest right icon on the bottom task bar to reach profile page
  <li> on user's profile page, click on the gear icon to go settings page </li>
  <li> search for the langauge option, click on it </li>
  <li> leads to a list of languages/li>
  <li> click on the desired language </li>
   <li> a pop up screen appears to show user they changed the app's language</li>
   <li> click the x on the pop up screen </li>
   <li> keep clicking back on the settings pages to go back to profile page</li>
  </ol>
  
  
  Cognitve Walkthrough:



Below are the comments I recieved for the app:
  1.) change icon for discover
  2.) there are some typos
  3.) revisit the settings page and fix the spacing
  4.) make it more obvious that the user can search for books, groups, lists, using both discover and the search bar
  
  And all of these changes I will make to the app since I consider them sound advice.
