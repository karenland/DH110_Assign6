# DH110_Assign6

<h2>Description of project: </h2>
<p>While low-fidelity prototyping allows us to study the general idea of the screens/steps we hope to create for our designs, high fidelity prototyping (but this assignment in particular) allows us to highlight a single component of our app and gather feedback of items that are directly related to the constitution of the app (i.e.font, color scheme, text size, image size, etc.) Basically high fidelity testing gets us as close as we can get to the actual application/website UI without actually constructing the entire application/website. Another interesting outcome of high-fidelity  testing is that we are also able to more accurately time how long a user takes to do a task.</p>
  
 So for my screen designs, the user will be joining a book group by searching for them in the search bar. The basic system steps are:
 <ol>
  <li> home page shows the most popular books right now. task bar is at the bottom and there is a search icon at the top of the screen as well as within taskbar </li>
  <li> clicking on eother search icon, opens up a list of choices to narrow search for user </li>
  <li> user clicks on options to narrow down search </li>
  <li> user clicks on search icon again to intiate the search procress </li>
  <li> results are separated by books, lists, and book groups</li>
   <li> user can click from the results page to open up the "profile/information page" or can click on the arrows to open more results related to book groups</li>
   <li> an informational profile page of the book group opens and at the bottom is a join option</li>
   <li> user clicks JOIN button to join group</li>
 <li> a pop up confirming the user joined the group appears </li>
   <li> user clicks on "X" botton located on the upper right part of the screen to go back to the previous page </li>
  </ol>


<h2>Design System:</h2>

<h3>Font: Libre Baskerville</h3>
<p>The font I chose for my screen designs is Libre Baskerville. Since it is taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast”  it is suitable for reading on the screen. It is primarily used for body text and since my current and future screen designs will be using a lot of text, I think using Libre Baskerville as the principal font is a good choice. Once again, this is the only font I am using to make sure the overall design of the prototype is cohesive but I am considering adding another font to differentiate between the “bookish” details and app features (for example book titles vs search results). Also, the font reminds me of a more modern version of the actual fonts used in physical books. I alos added a period after most of the titles in the app to maintan a "bookish" mode. But after I add in the logo, I think I may remove the periods since hopefully, the logo will be enough to maintain the mood I want. </p>

<h3>Color scheme: background, primary (default text), focus (ex. button)</h3>
<p>Figuring out the color palette was difficult. I did try to make the process of choosing one easier by relying on color psychology but even researching the colors and the associated meanings made it a bit harder. Since this is a social and an archive app, it has to highlight the books themselves as well as the sense of the community users will experience when they use the app. So I wanted the color palette to be warm and inviting… a bit like actual books. Below I included the color palettes passing the contrast test: the top one is the one I am using for the light mode and beige variations of the app while the second one is for the dark mode variation.

**Layout grid + spacing:**
<p>I am still researching the best way to go about the layout of the app. As I was studying different apps, I see that the biggest issue many have is following the Gestalt Principle of Proximity. Poor formatting can lead to different sections being too close to one another (like the in class assignment I did on Suzanne Collins website) and cause readiability to be difficult. I also remembered that for many years, GoodReads (a social and archive app about books) had a poor layout grid since text and hyperlinks seemed to be in random places on their website. So that is also another aspect, having a layout grid that does not make sense, I am trying to avoid it. Right now, I am currently using lines to separate different sectioned text. For example, the search results have very faint lines separating each search result. And on book groups’ discussion pages, the different section titles are underlined to differentiate between one another. For the spacing between components I did it manuallly but I will try to update the design so that I am using the "Stack" feature of Framer. </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p> Honestly, as I was creating the screens, I already changed my mind on how the results will be shown. The ideas I have seem to involve coding so hopefully for the next assignment it will be ready. For the Impression Test, I saw that there are two variations: 1.) a 15 second glance then discussion 2.) a minute long test where the user goes through the steps/screens. I decided to do both! 

**First Impression Test:** for the 15 second glance I showed the screenshots I took for the light mode and dark mode variations. For the light mode, the user commented "That it looks real." "simple." "very simple." "bookie!". Simplicity was what I was going for so I am happy they commented that. 
For the dark mode, "it looks real." "smart." like I get it." I think for their last comment, they mean the color scheme for dark mode since the quote before (seemed to be) pertained to the color scheme as well.

**Second Impression Test**
a minute long test: asked them to search for a book group to join by searching for one using the sear bar. They completed the task very quickly so I told them to take their time until the minute is up. 

Some thoughts they had: "it was difficult to start." since they did not know how to begin the task. I did try to prompt them but they would just say by asking "How was your experience" and "Any thoughts you have?" The latter question I hoped would lead to more opinions being shared since I learned in one of my lingutitcs class, that "any" while used in negative sentences, can elicit repsonses since it causes people to think to see if they actually have **just any** thoughts/opinons/questions. The user simply said "it was nice." And honestly, I do consider this a bit of a victory since for my last prototype, my drawings were commical to the other user. So them not having a definite opinion of the app is fine for me right now since it shows my protoype is "mundane" enough to pass off as an actual interfernace. 

**Final Thoughts:** As mentioned before, I already know what I want to change: the search function and the layout of the results page. For my intial search option, I was inspired by Discord's search function since it makes it so easy to find messages sow hile I think a similiar one may work for my app, I think for the intended users, it will be better if I change it. I did not go through many difficulties, I just struggled a bit understanding how Framer components work but I plan on studying them more to use them later. But I also just felt limited by own knowledge. I am a Linguistics Major; however, I have not yet formally studied topics related to "Localization" (a field I am interested in). I felt applying some here would be suitbale for my app since I plan on adding multi-language suppport.
