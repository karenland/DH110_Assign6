<h2>Description of project: </h2>
<p>While low-flow protuping allows us to study the general idea  of the screens/steps we hope to create for our designs, high fidelity prototyping allows us to highlight a single component of our app and gather feedback of items that are directly related to the constitution of the app (i.e.font, color scheme, text size, image size, etc.) Basically high fidelity testing gets us as close as we can get to the actual application/website UI without actually constructing the entire prototype. Another interesting outcome of high deity testing is that we are also able to more accurately time how long a user takes to do a task. So for my screen designs, the user will be joining a book group by searching for them in the search bar.</p>


<h2>Design System:</h2>

**Font: Libre Baskerville**
<p>The font I chose for my screen designs is Libre Baskerville. Since it is taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast”  it is suitable for reading on the screen. It is primarily used for body text and since my current and future screen designs will be itzling a lot of text, I think using Libre Baskerville as the principal font is a good choice. Once again,  this is the only font I am using to make sure the overall design of the prototype is cohesive but I am considering adding another font to differentiate between the “bookish” details and app features (for example book titles vs search results). Also, the font reminds me of a more modern venison of the actual fonts used in physical books.</p>

**Color scheme: background, primary (default text), focus (ex. button)**
<p>Figuring out the color palette was difficult. I did try to make the process of choosing one easier by relying on color psychology but even researching the colors and the associated meanings made it a bit harder. Since this is a social and an archive app, it has to highlight the books themselves as well as the sense of the community users will experience when they use the app. So I wanted the color palette to be warm and inviting… a bit like actual books.  

**Layout grid + spacing:**
<p>I am still researching the best way to go about the layout of the app. As I was studying different apps, I see that the biggest issue many have is following the Gestalt Principle of Proximity since poor formatting can lead to different sections being too close to one another (like the in class assignment I did on Suzanne Collins website. I also remembered that for many years, GoodReads had a poor layout grid since text and hyperlinks seemed to be in random places on the apps. So that is also another aspect, having a layout grid that does not make sense, I am trying to avoid it.Right now, I am currently using lines to separate different sectioned text. For example, the search results have very faint lines separating each search result. And on book groups’ discussion pages, the different section titles are underlined to differentiate between one another. </p>
