<h2>Description of project: </h2>
<p>While low-fidelity prototyping allows us to study the general idea of the screens/steps we hope to create for our designs, high fidelity prototyping (but this assignment in particular) allows us to highlight a single component of our app and gather feedback of items that are directly related to the constitution of the app (i.e.font, color scheme, text size, image size, etc.) Basically high fidelity testing gets us as close as we can get to the actual application/website UI without actually constructing the entire application/website. Another interesting outcome of high-fidelity  testing is that we are also able to more accurately time how long a user takes to do a task.</p>
  
 So for my screen designs, the user will be joining a book group by searching for them in the search bar. The basic system steps are:
 <ol>
  <li> home page shows the most popular books right now. task bar is at the bottom and there is a search icon at the top of the screen as well as within taskbar </li>
  <li> clicking on eother search icon, opens up a list of choices to narrow search for user </li>
  <li> user clicks on options to narrow down search </li>
  <li> user clicks on search icon again to intiate the search procress </li>
  <li> results are separated by books, lists, and book groups</li>
   <li> user can click from the results page to open up the "profile/information page" or can click on the arrows to open more results related to book groups</li>
   <li> an informational profile page of the book group opens and at the bottom is a join option</li>
   <li> user clicks JOIN button to join group</li>
 <li> a pop up confirming the user joined the group appears </li>
   <li> user clicks on "X" botton located on the upper right part of the screen to go back to the previous page </li>
  </ol>


<h2>Design System:</h2>

**Font: Libre Baskerville**
<p>The font I chose for my screen designs is Libre Baskerville. Since it is taller x-height, wider counters and a little less contrast”  it is suitable for reading on the screen. It is primarily used for body text and since my current and future screen designs will be itzling a lot of text, I think using Libre Baskerville as the principal font is a good choice. Once again,  this is the only font I am using to make sure the overall design of the prototype is cohesive but I am considering adding another font to differentiate between the “bookish” details and app features (for example book titles vs search results). Also, the font reminds me of a more modern venison of the actual fonts used in physical books.</p>

**Color scheme: background, primary (default text), focus (ex. button)**
<p>Figuring out the color palette was difficult. I did try to make the process of choosing one easier by relying on color psychology but even researching the colors and the associated meanings made it a bit harder. Since this is a social and an archive app, it has to highlight the books themselves as well as the sense of the community users will experience when they use the app. So I wanted the color palette to be warm and inviting… a bit like actual books.  

**Layout grid + spacing:**
<p>I am still researching the best way to go about the layout of the app. As I was studying different apps, I see that the biggest issue many have is following the Gestalt Principle of Proximity. Poor formatting can lead to different sections being too close to one another (like the in class assignment I did on Suzanne Collins website) and cuase readiability to be difficult. I also remembered that for many years, GoodReads (a social and archive app) had a poor layout grid since text and hyperlinks seemed to be in random places on their website. So that is also another aspect, having a layout grid that does not make sense, I am trying to avoid it. Right now, I am currently using lines to separate different sectioned text. For example, the search results have very faint lines separating each search result. And on book groups’ discussion pages, the different section titles are underlined to differentiate between one another. </p>

The Actual Steps + Task:
This screen design is meant to highlight
